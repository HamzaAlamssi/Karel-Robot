Karel the robot is required to divide 
Karel’s map into 4 equal chambers, if not possible then to the 
largest number of chambers. I’ve come up with a solution that 
utilizes reusable functions and methods to divide the map 
with the least beepers and steps. 
By implementing a function to go to a certain point and karel 
will move to it accordingly, while also using a handful of 
reusable movement and beepers functions
